          <h2>About This Site</h2>
          <p>
            This is a site where hopefully if I keep it updated I can get better
            at drawing. And that you guys can see progress as the years go by.
            It will also be a place where you can hopefully laugh at my terrible
            drawings

        <h2>Why YOU Should Care</h2>
        <p>
          You should care a lot because it will make the person behind this page
          very happy. But if you dont well thats ok I guess its you personal
          choise to care or not, really doesnt make a difference to me if you do
          or not. But for those who decide to follow my journey (and I keep this
          updated) will get some content they can look forward to.
